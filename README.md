# 👋🏾 Hi, I’m Latrisha Dodson

**Cybersecurity Fellow | Detection & Response | Cloud Security | Creative Technologist**

I design, document, and defend systems at the intersection of **cloud security**, **automation**, and **creative thinking**.  
Current focus: building **real-world SOC workflows** and **documented AWS security labs** that hiring managers can actually read, understand, and trust.

---

## 🔐 Current Roles & Focus

- **Cybersecurity Fellow – The Knowledge House (Innovation Fellowship 2025)**
  - Phase 2–4: advanced projects in **cloud security, SIEM, and incident response**
  - Heavy emphasis on **documented labs**, **GitHub-driven portfolios**, and **team-based architectures**

- **Data Quarantine / Automation Engineer (Team Projects)**
  - **“SOC it to ’EM SIEMlessly”**  
    - Multi-tenant security monitoring project with a focus on **log ingestion, enrichment, and detection logic**
  - **“Global Viral Research Defense Center (GVRDC)”**  
    - Designing data-quarantine-focused architectures on AWS for security monitoring and incident response

- **Creative Consultant & Pet-Care Entrepreneur**
  - Translating skills from **fashion, costume design, and brand storytelling** into:
    - Clear technical documentation
    - Human-friendly security narratives
    - A long-term vision for **“The Pawtier House”**, a luxury pet-care and wellness brand

## 🧠 Technical Skills (In Progress & Applied)

**Security & Cloud**
- AWS: VPC, S3 (logging & versioning), CloudTrail, GuardDuty, Security Hub, Lambda
- Logging & Detection: CloudTrail logs, VPC Flow Logs, Athena queries, basic detection use cases
- Identity & Access: IAM roles/policies, least privilege mindset, basic security baselines

**Dev & Automation**
- Infrastructure-as-Code concepts (Terraform basics for AWS resources)
- Git & GitHub: branching, pull requests, README-driven documentation, evidence folders
- Basic scripting and CLI usage to support repeatable lab setups

**Foundations**
- CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)
- Defense-in-Depth thinking (layers: network, identity, logging, training, process)
- Email & domain protection concepts (MFA, filters, DMARC at a conceptual level)

## 🌐 Featured Projects

### 1. AWS Cyber Range-Style Lab (Hands-On Compromise & Detection)
**Repo:** [aws-cyberrange-lab] (https://github.com/ldodson10/cyber-range-lab-aws)

A guided AWS lab where I:
- Simulated a compromised EC2 instance using controlled scenarios  
- Enabled CloudTrail, GuardDuty, and Security Hub to surface findings  
- Practiced **triage, documentation, and cleanup** with AWS Free Tier in mind

**Highlights**
- Focused on **cost-aware security** – enabling services for the lab, then disabling to avoid surprise bills  
- Produced step-by-step screenshots and README sections for:
  - Environment setup
  - Attack simulation
  - Detection & remediation
  - Cleanup & lessons learned

---

### 2. AWS S3 + Lambda Ingestion Pipeline
**Repo:** [aws-s3-lambda-ingestion] (https://github.com/ldodson10/aws-s3-lambda-ingestion

A small but practical serverless pattern:
- **S3** used as an ingestion point
- **Lambda** automatically triggered by new objects
- Designed for **scalable log or data processing**

**What I practiced**
- Event-driven design (S3 → Lambda)
- Writing clear, reproducible instructions for others to clone and deploy
- Highlighting **security considerations**: IAM roles, least privilege, environment variables

---

### 3. “SOC it to ’EM SIEMlessly” – Team SOC / SIEM Project
**Repo(s):** [SOC it to ’EM SIEMlessly] (https://github.com/ldodson10/SOC-it-to-EM-SIEMlessly)

**Problem space:** How can a small SOC (or MSSP) provide **repeatable, multi-tenant security monitoring** without drowning in manual work?

**My contributions**
- Helped design and reason about:
  - Log ingestion flows
  - Detection logic tied to practical attack scenarios
  - Evidence and architecture documentation
- Collaborated with a cross-functional team of fellows, pairing **technical setup** with **clear write-ups** (what we did, why it matters, how to extend it)

---

### 4. GVRDC AWS Infra – “Data Quarantine Architect”
**Repo:** [gvrdc-aws-infra] (https://github.com/nyahhepburn/gvrdc-aws-infra)
**Scenario:** A global research defense center needs a secure, well-logged cloud footprint.

**My focus**
- VPC and S3 setup for logging and “data quarantine” concepts
- Ensuring CloudTrail and VPC Flow Logs were wired into a logging S3 bucket
- Contributing to **architecture diagrams** and **compliance/governance views**:
  - CloudTrail → S3 (log bucket with versioning)
  - (Planned) Glue + Athena for queryable logs
  - DynamoDB / other stores for future state tracking

**Key strength:** When AWS permissions blocked certain pieces, I still documented the **intended architecture**, constraints, and next steps like a real-world engineer would.

## 🎨 Creative & Brand Experience (Bonus Dimension)

Before and alongside cybersecurity, I’ve worked in:
- **Fashion & Costume Design** – Peabody & Satellite Award–winning productions
- **Art Direction & Visual Storytelling**
- **Pet-Care & Luxury Service Branding** – The Pawtier House (concept in progress)

What this adds to my security work:
- Strong visual communication (diagrams, flows, layouts)
- High standard for how documentation **looks** and **reads**
- Empathy for non-technical stakeholders who need security explained in plain language

---

## 📚 What I’m Learning Next

- CompTIA Security+ vs. AWS Certified Security (deciding the best first move and aligning with my AWS background)
- Deeper SIEM workflows: enrichment, correlation rules, and practical dashboards
- More robust Terraform usage to fully codify my AWS labs
- How to merge **cybersecurity, branding, and pet-care** into a sustainable, multi-stream career

## 🤝 Collaboration & Contact

I’m open to:
- Entry-level and apprenticeship-style roles in **Security Operations, Cloud Security, or Detection Engineering**
- Projects where I can:
  - Stand up or document security labs
  - Clean up chaotic GitHub repos & READMEs
  - Help teams tell a clear, compelling story about their security posture

**Let’s connect:**
- **LinkedIn:** (https://www.linkedin.com/in/latdod/)
- **GitHub:** `@ldodson10`
- **Email:** (latrishadodson@gmail.com)

If you’re building security programs, training pathways, or creative tech projects and need someone who can **own both the work and the documentation**, I’d love to talk.
